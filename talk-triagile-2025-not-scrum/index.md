::: notes
- come as you are
- participation comes in many forms
- how are you going to show up?
- who came to listen to silence?

:::

## only how we react

## you are the problem

## not really

## are you ready to be the hero?

# the struggle bus {.text-hl data-background-image="bus.jpg"}


::: notes

- they're not doing agile right? (or PI planning, daily meeting)
- the leader trap - who gets to decide?
- have you READ the scrum guide?
- Are you seeing the downtrend online and/or in your communities? How does that impact you?

## time for a game

## who knows the scrum guide?

## each person should have a story to work this sprint

## no

> "They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how."

## Scrum master should be facilitating stakeholder collaboration

## yes

> The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:
> Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.

## teams should refine and size work weekly in story points

## no

story points are never mentioned, only "sizing"

> [Refinement] is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size.

## daily scrum has 3 questions

> The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as
> long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and
> produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.

## the dev manager is not part of the team

## no

Neither development nor delivery managers are mentioned in the scrum guide
